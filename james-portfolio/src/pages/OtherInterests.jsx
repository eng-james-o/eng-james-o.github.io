      <h2>STEM Advocacy & Education</h2>
      <p>
        I am deeply committed to making STEM education accessible and inspiring for young people across Africa.
        Through initiatives like <strong><a href="https://www.flyinglabs.org/nigeria">Nigeria Flying Labs</a></strong> and <strong>Aero-flight Tech Initiative</strong>, 
        I offer pro-bono and paid STEM training in underserved communities and premium secondary schools. 
        These programs focus on robotics, drones, and artificial intelligence, helping students develop hands-on skills and explore future careers in tech.

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of engineering and data science, music is a big part of my life. I enjoy playing the guitar and piano—
        both as a form of creative expression and personal relaxation. Whether improvising chords or composing something original,
        I believe music and engineering share a beautiful symmetry rooted in rhythm, structure, and creativity.

      <h2>Chess</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an avid chess enthusiast. The game sharpens strategic thinking, foresight, and decision-making—skills that are essential in both tech leadership and research. I occasionally play online matches, and enjoy using chess as a tool to break deadlock while facing difficult tasks.
