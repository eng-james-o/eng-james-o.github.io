<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Remote control over 4G/LTE networks</li>
  <li>Long-range surveillance capabilities</li>
  <li>Live video streaming and telemetry</li>
  <li>Custom autopilot integration</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This project aims to create a drone that can be controlled from anywhere with 4G coverage, making it ideal for surveillance tasks in remote areas. The drone is equipped with a high-definition camera for real-time video streaming and can be controlled via a custom-built ground control station. <br>
  The integration of a 4G module allows for reliable communication even in areas where traditional radio control signals may be weak or unavailable and as a proof of concept, the drone was controlled entirely from a laptop, relying on its autonomous flight capacity to provide flexibility and ease of use.
